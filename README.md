# EMart
EMART is a multivendor e-commerce website built using Django, a popular Python-based web framework. The website has three modules - buyer, seller, and admin - to cater to the different user roles.

Buyers can browse and purchase products from multiple sellers, add products to their cart, and make payments securely through the website. They can also view their order history and track the status of their orders.

Sellers, on the other hand, can create their own store, add products to their inventory, and manage orders received from buyers. They can also view sales reports and manage their store's settings.

The admin module provides an interface to manage the website's overall functionality, including user management, order management, and store management. Admins can also view sales reports and generate analytics to help improve the website's performance.

EMART is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for buyers while enabling sellers to easily manage their online store. The website's intuitive interface and robust features make it a convenient and efficient platform for online shopping.
